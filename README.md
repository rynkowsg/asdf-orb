Use ASDF in your CircleCI pipelines.

[What are Orbs?](https://circleci.com/orbs/)

## Motivation

**Single Source of Truth**

Leverage your .tool-versions file as the single source of truth.
There's no longer a need to synchronize tooling between your CI environment and your local setup.

**Ease of Integrating Tools into CI**

Utilize the .tool-versions file for straightforward tool integration in your CI pipeline.

**Reduced Time to Action**

The more specialized your Docker image, the longer it might take to fetch.
With asdf-orb, you can start with a widely-used, or even a base image,
and install everything you need using just one command.
Plus, by caching this setup, you can speed up restoration for even quicker starts in the future.

## Status

The orb's got just the `install` command for now. But after you've got ASDF installed,
adding plugins and tool installations can be easily accomplished from a regular `run` step.
For examples, see:
- [shellpack's CircleCI configuration](https://github.com/rynkowsg/shellpack/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml)
- [clj-gr's CircleCI configuration](https://github.com/rynkowsg/clj-gr/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml)

> [!WARNING]
> This is **early alpha**. Keep this in mind that interface might change[^warning-alpha].

[^warning-alpha]: That said, it's probably still better option to choose the update your repo later, if interface change, than whipping up your own asdf scripts.
