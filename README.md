Use ASDF in your CircleCI pipelines.

[What are Orbs?](https://circleci.com/orbs/)

## Motivation

**Single Source of Truth**

Leverage your .tool-versions file as the single source of truth.
There's no longer a need to synchronize tooling between your CI environment and your local setup.

**Ease of Integrating Tools into CI**

Utilize the .tool-versions file for straightforward tool integration in your CI pipeline.

**Reduced Time to Action**

The more specialized your Docker image, the longer it might take to fetch.
With asdf-orb, you can start with a widely-used, or even a base image,
and install everything you need using just one command.
Plus, by caching this setup, you can speed up restoration for even quicker starts in the future.

## Quickstart

version: '2.1'

  asdf: rynkowsg/asdf-orb@0.1.0
